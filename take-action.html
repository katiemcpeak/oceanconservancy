    <h2 class="take-action-title">Help Support America's Greatest Natural Resource</h2>
    <p class="take-action-p">President Obama just released his draft budget for running the country in 2017. Ocean Conservancy is really excited to see that this budget includes funding ocean conservation projects! His budget underscores the importance of coastal resiliency, science-based strategies and solutions to ensure that our ocean and the people that most depend on it continue to thrive. There is a long way to go before the budget is finally agreed upon. We need your help to make sure that the good pieces of ocean conservation funding remain in the final budget when itâ€™s passed by Congress.</p>
    
    <h3 class="take-action-h3">Can we count on you to help?</h3>
    <p class="take-action-p">Please take action today and tell your members of Congress that you support investing in a healthy ocean that benefits America's wildlife, communities and economy.</p>
